Liar's Lair - a card game for between 3 and 10 players

There are two decks of cards, each card from one deck has an equivalent card in the other deck that has a conflicting piece of information. For example one deck might have "Goats are reknown for their love of prunes" while the other would have "Goats hate prunes". The information on the cards is intentionally bizarre so that it may not be independenctly verified, individual card pairs may also be swapped between decks, provided they never appear in the same deck.

## Starting a game

1. At the start of play one deck is chosen at random to be the "deck of lies", while the other is the "deck of truth". The decks are shuffled
2. Each player is given an equal number of cards from both decks and are informed of which cards are facts and which cards are lies. 
	* Note that players only know of the truthfulness of their own cards, not the other players. 
	* Players may write secret notes at any time (not on the cards though - are you crazy?)
3. A player is selected at random to start the first round. Players may volunteer to start the first round, if multiple players volunteer, the starting person is selected at random from those players

## Playing a hand

1. The starting player picks a card from their hand and plays it
2. The player immedately to the left of that player then plays a card, if that card contradicts any card in play then 
	1. the person who played the lie card is knocked out of the game 
	2. both cards are immedately removed from play
	3. the person who played the truth card may select a card from the departing players deck, however that player will not be able to reclaim a card at the end of the round
3. The round continues until everyone has played one card

## Finishing a round

1. The starting player reclaims a card from the cards in play (excepting the card they themselves have just played), unless they have knocked out another player this round, in which case they skip picking up a card
2. The player immediately to the left then reclaims a card, unless they have knocked out another player this round, in which case they skip picking up a card
3. The round continues until there are no more cards
4. The player to the left of the starting player becomes the new starting player and the round continues

## Winning

The game is won when one of three things happen
1. All players except one are knocked out
2. A player has a hand containing all truth cards
	1. A player may declare this at the end of a round, however if they get it wrong they will be knocked out of the game
3. None of the remaining players can prove the other to be a liar
	1. A player may declare a stalemate at the end of a round, however if they get it wrong they will be knocked out of the game
